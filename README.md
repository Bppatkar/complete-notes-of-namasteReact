| 1. [chapter-01-inception-namaste-react](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/chapter-01-inception-namaste-react)   | Chapter-01 (Inception) was the first session of the Namaste React Live course. The whole class was excited about the beginning of a great course. We started learning react from scratch. Environment setup was clearly explained. Started with creating a simple Hello world program . First, using only html, then we tried to implement the same through javascript. Finally, we created a simple hello world program using React. Everything was done without installing any package. Unlike other courses which starts with create-react-app as first session, we tried writing the react code from zero. It was a true inception session for tranforming from ZERO to HERO in React. | [Chapter-01 Live ](https://learn-react-with-harshi-chapter-01.netlify.app/) | 
|  ```<Profile name = { "Harshi"} age={28}   />``` |  ``` const Profile = (props) => { let name = props.name; let age = props.age; } ``` |  
| 2.   Similar to the way mentioned in 1.          | Props object can be destructed using {} to receive only the required props| 
| ```<Profile name = { "Harshi"} age={28}   />```  | ``` const Profile = ({name, age}) => { } ```    | 
| 3. Using spread syntax                           |  And props objects destructed using {}        |
| ```<Profile {...props}   />```   | ``` const Profile = ({name, age}) => { } ```  |
